Problem Description
Imagine the scene. You are eleven years old, and in the five minutes before the end of the lesson, your Maths teacher decides he should make his class more “fun” by introducing a “game”. He explains that he is going to point at each pupil in turn and ask them to say the next number in sequence, starting from one. The “fun” part is that if the number is divisible by three, you instead say “Fizz” and if it is divisible by five you say “Buzz”. So now your maths teacher is pointing at all of your classmates in turn, and they happily shout “one!”, “two!”, “Fizz!”, “four!”, “Buzz!”… until he very deliberately points at you, fixing you with a steely gaze… time stands still, your mouth dries up, your palms become sweatier and sweatier until you finally manage to croak “Fizz!”. Doom is avoided, and the pointing finger moves on.

So of course in order to avoid embarassment infront of your whole class, you have to get the full list printed out so you know what to say. Your class has about 33 pupils and he might go round three times before the bell rings for breaktime. Next maths lesson is on Thursday. Get coding!

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz “.



Prime Factors
Compute the prime factors of a given natural number.

A prime number is only evenly divisible by itself and 1.

Note that 1 is not a prime number.

Example
What are the prime factors of 60?

Our first divisor is 2. 2 goes into 60, leaving 30.
2 goes into 30, leaving 15.
2 doesn't go cleanly into 15. So let's move on to our next divisor, 3.
3 goes cleanly into 15, leaving 5.
3 does not go cleanly into 5. The next possible factor is 4.
4 does not go cleanly into 5. The next possible factor is 5.
5 does go cleanly into 5.
We're left only with 1, so now, we're done.
Our successful divisors in that computation represent the list of prime factors of 60: 2, 2, 3, and 5.
